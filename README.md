We have built a platform that enables remote workplace collaboration. Our communication service allows you to "approach the desks" of your coworkers, and join an impromptu voice call with them. Users can join an "office" of other users. Once a user joins an office, they can see all of the other office members' statuses (whether they're available for a call or "away for their desk"), and if anyone else is talking at someone's desk.


TokSpace is made for visiting your co-workwork's desk and chit-chat, and oh well! you can do this while you're at home! :smile:(Don't forget we are in the middle of a pandemic :sob:, but you can still talk without your mask on :grin:)
Check out when the other peron is available and **Pull Up** their profile to talk. You can join office rooms/sessions with multiple people. 

TokSpace checks the running apps like PyCharm and VS Code, while your status is available your peers can come to your desk and chat.

You can use both video and audio calls. Text feature would be available in the future version. 

You can also set your availability off whenever you don't want your co-workers lurking at your desk.
