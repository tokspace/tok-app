# TokSpace

### We can Divide who can speak what or one person can give the complete overview

### ---- INTRO---

TokSpace is made for visiting your co-workwork's desk and chit-chat, and oh well do this while you're at home! :smile:(Don't forget we are in the middle of a Pandemic :sob:, but you can still talk w/o your mask on :grin:)
Check out when the other peron is available and **Pull Up** their profile to talk. 

TokSpace checks the running apps like PyCharm and VS Code, while your status is available your peers can come to your desk and chat.

You can use both video and audio calls. Text feature would be available in the future releases. 

Technologies Used:

We have used Electron+React to make the frontend look sweet!
To save data Firebase is used. Firestore is lit yeah :fire: 
To handle the Backendy stuff we used Node.j

Connecting streams and see your co-workers have been made possible by SimplePeer :tada:

Let's Go to see how the magic happens :wink:
